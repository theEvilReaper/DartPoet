/**
 * A helper class that holds references to writer implementations.
 * Maintaining a single instance of each writer improves runtime performance
 * by avoiding the overhead of creating new instances for each write operation.
 *
 * Since writer classes do not store any state, creating new instances is unnecessary.
 *
 * **Note**: Update this class only when adding or removing writer implementations.
