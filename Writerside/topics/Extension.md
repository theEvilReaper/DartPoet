# Extension

Modern programming languages have a feature that allows the creation of additional methods to existing libraries.
Those methods acts like normal methods which are defined in the library itself. In the development process of an
application developers doesn't really know if the method they are using is an extension or not.
This functionality can be used in case where you need to add additional method but doesn't have the ability to change
the used library directly.

### Create an extension method

DartPoet provides a dedicated spec object for the usage of extension structures.
