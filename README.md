# **DartPoet is still in development and not ready for production use.**

## Description
Helps developers to write dart code in a more fluent way via kotlin api.
## Motivation
Our company uses kotlin for all of our projects. We wanted to write our dart code in a more fluent way. So we decided to write our own library for code generation.
## Focus
Our focus lies within a basic implementation of DartPoet, its core and reaching the goal of stable builds to use it in production later on.
